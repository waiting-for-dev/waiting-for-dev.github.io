Hello, I'm Marc.

I work as an Elixir software engineer at [Remote.com](https://remote.com/), where we are building the future of work by enabling companies to employ anyone, anywhere in the world.

I've also been a Rubyist for ages, developing a strong affinity for functional programming. You can often find me advocating for a functional approach to the language, leveraging its flexibility and expressiveness to craft code that seamlessly combines object-oriented and functional paradigms.
