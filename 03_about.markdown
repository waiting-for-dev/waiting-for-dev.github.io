Hello, I'm Marc.

I have a strong affinity for Ruby and a deep appreciation for functional programming. You'll often find me advocating for a functional approach to the language, leveraging its flexibility and expressiveness to craft code that seamlessly combines object-oriented and functional paradigms.
