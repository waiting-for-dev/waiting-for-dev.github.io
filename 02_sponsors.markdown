Would you consider [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/waiting-for-dev/)?

My mission in the realm of open source is to promote the adoption of a functional approach in Ruby, making it more mainstream. Currently, I am actively contributing to the development of the [Hanami](https://github.com/hanami) framework in collaboration with the [dry-rb](https://github.com/dry-rb) ecosystem, both of which embody this mindset at their core. Additionally, I am the creator of [web_pipe](https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/web_pipe), a library that empowers the construction of rack applications with a strong emphasis on composability.

In the future, I plan to use this concept to create projects with a positive social impact, as I firmly believe that technology should prioritize societal well-being. You might also catch me crafting tools for developers, most likely in purely functional programming languages such as Elixir or Haskell.

Balancing my full-time job and caring for my two wonderful kids leaves me with limited time for open source contributions, making your collaboration incredibly valuable in supporting my journey.

A special note of gratitude to:

- [Sebastian Wilgosz](https://github.com/swilgosz) of [HanamiMastery](https://hanamimastery.com)
