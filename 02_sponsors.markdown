Would you like to [sponsor me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/waiting-for-dev/)?

My calling in open source is to make a functional approach Ruby more
mainstream. I'm currently helping to build the [Hanami
framework](https://github.com/hanami) together with the
[dry-rb](https://github.com/dry-rb) ecosystem, where this mindset is at its
core. I'm also the author of
[web_pipe](https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/web_pipe), a library that allows
building rack applications than can compose.

In the future, you can expect me to try to leverage this idea to build
something with a positive social impact, as I think that should be technology's
primary goal. You could also see me building some tools for developers probably
in purely functional programming languages like Elixir or Haskell.

I have a full-time job and two amazing kids with whom I love spending my time,
so finding time for Open Source is always challenging. Your collaboration is of
great value in supporting me on this path.

Special thanks to:

- [Sebastian Wilgosz](https://github.com/swilgosz) of [HanamiMastery](https://hanamimastery.com)
