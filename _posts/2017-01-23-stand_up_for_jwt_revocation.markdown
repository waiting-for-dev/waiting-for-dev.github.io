There is some debate about whether JWT tokens should be revoked, for example, when signing a user out, or whether doing so is nonsense and breaks the primary reason why this technology exists.

JWT tokens are self-describing. They encapsulate the information that a client is trying to provide to an API, such as the ID of a user trying to authenticate. For this reason, they are defined as stateless. The server only needs to validate that the incoming token has its own signature to trust it; it doesn't have to query any other server, like a database or another API.

Self-describing tokens exist in opposition to more traditional opaque tokens, which are usually strings of characters that an API needs to check against another server to see if they match the one associated with a user record.

The stateless nature of a pure JWT implementation has a very important implication. A server has nothing to say about a token except whether it was signed by itself or not, so it has no way to revoke them individually (it could invalidate all issued tokens at once by changing its signing key, but not a single one in isolation). This means that it is not possible to create an actual sign-out request from the server-side.

Even though this fact can be seen as a testament to stateless purism, I consider it close to an abomination from a security point of view. It is true that if both the client and API belong to the same team, client-side token revocation can be kept under control. But server-side technologies have better tools to deal with security and fewer attack vectors, like, say, a web browser. If the API is consumed by third-party clients, then relying on the assumption that they will do the right job is completely unacceptable.

However, there is nothing in JWT technology that prevents adding a revocation layer on top of it. In this scenario, an incoming token is verified, and, like in opaque tokens, another server is reached to check if it is still valid.

At first glance, it actually seems like nonsense. It looks like we are ending up in the same land as opaque tokens with the additional signature verification overhead. However, a closer look reveals that we gain some security benefits and that, in fact, there is no such overhead.

Let's first examine the security benefits we can get. When revoking a JWT token, there is no need to store the whole token in the database. As it contains readable information, we can, for example, extract its "jti" claim, which uniquely identifies it. This is a huge advantage because it means that the stored information is completely useless for an attacker. Therefore, there is no need to hash it to implement a good zero-knowledge policy, and there is no need to keep a salt value for each user to protect against rainbow table attacks.

Now, about the alleged overhead that JWT with revocation would entail. As we said, with JWT, we have to take two steps: signature verification and a server query. In opaque tokens, it seems like we only have to query the server. But that is not true. A secure opaque token implementation should not store unencrypted tokens. Instead, it should require the client to send a kind of user UID along with the unencrypted token. The user UID would be used to fetch the user, and the unencrypted token would be securely compared with the hashed one. So, this hash comparison is also a second step, which, even though I haven't benchmarked it, should have a similar overhead to signature verification.

Using a standard like JWT also has some abstract benefits that are difficult to measure. For example, usually, with current libraries, you get integrated expiration management through the "exp" claim. However, as far as I know, there is no standard for opaque tokens, which makes libraries prone to reinvent the wheel every time. In general, using JWT should be more portable.

Of course, I'm not saying that JWT with revocation is always good and opaque tokens are always bad. There have been detected JWT-specific attacks that good libraries should have fixed, and irresponsible use of JWT can have some dangers that we'll examine in further posts. In the end, developers must be aware of what they are using, and a secure opaque token implementation is also very valid. But adding the revocation layer on top of JWT shouldn't be disregarded as easily. In the next post, we'll take a look at some revocation strategies that can be implemented.
