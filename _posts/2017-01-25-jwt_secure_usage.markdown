In this post, after having discussed the [why]({% post_url 2017-01-23-stand_up_for_jwt_revocation %}) and [how]({% post_url 2017-01-24-jwt_revocation_strategies %}) on revoking JWT tokens, we'll talk about some general advice that should be kept in mind while using JWT for user authentication.

The most important one is what we have already mentioned: add a revocation layer on top of JWT, even if it implies losing its stateless nature. The opposite is, most of the time, not acceptable. But there are more aspects to consider.

* Donâ€™t add information that may change for a user. For instance, many times people recommend adding role information so that a database query can be saved. For example, in your JWT payload, you would add that Alice has the user ID and the `admin` role. What happens if `admin` privilege is revoked for Alice? If the token that states the opposite is still valid, they could still appear as an `admin`.

* Don't add private information unless you encrypt your tokens. Bare JWT (without encryption) is just a signed token. It means that the server perfectly knows whether it issued the incoming token or not. But the information contained in the token is readable by everyone ([try it in the 'Debugger' section on [JWT site](https://jwt.io/)); it is just base64 encoded. So I recommend just encoding harmless information like the user id.

* Be careful about what you use to identify a user. For example, if you just add the user id and you have two different user resources, say a User and an AdminUser, a valid token for the User with id 3 would be valid for the AdminUser with the same id. In this case, you should add and use something like a scope claim to distinguish between the two.

With all of that in mind, in my view, when choosing an authentication mechanism, if possible, you should prefer using cookies. They have been around for a long time and they are battle-tested. Authentication is an essential security aspect of an application, and the closer you stay to the standard way, the more peacefully you will sleep.

So, in which situations might it be better not to use cookies? I can think of two:

* It is not easy to share cookies between different domains. That's not true for [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) requests, where the Access-Control-Allow-Credentials header can be used to instruct the browser to accept them. But, for instance, routine GET requests exclude you from this option.

* Mobile platform support. It is no longer an issue for acceptable modern APIs, but if you need legacy compatibility, you could encounter troubles.

Besides, you should be aware that JWT authentication could expose you to [XSS attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), even though it is also true that cookies could expose you to [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks. In both cases, the best thing you can do is use good and modern tools and frameworks, always avoiding reinventing the wheel.
